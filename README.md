# big rat's emporium

big rat's emporium is an unblocked page filled with mostly Flash games, but has planned support for HTML5 and JS-DOS. Currently, this is in an extremely early stage of development, with an early UI and games list.

## Features
- Your favorite Flash Games running on the Ruffle Flash emulator (and AwayFL for AS3 later on)

## Planned Features
- HTML5 Games, that you may see on other more popular websites.

- Youtube Unblocking program to remove the Restricted Mode feature (will not remove 18+ restrictions)

- Hidden Tab Details for easier security

- Lack of History Logging

- DOS Games like the shareware version of DOOM 1993, running through JS-DOS

- Mirrors if the only current one gets blocked
