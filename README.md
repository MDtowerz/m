# big rat's emporium

big rat's emporium is an unblocked page filled with mostly Flash games, but has planned support for HTML5 and JS-DOS. Currently, this is in an extremely early stage of development, with an early UI and games list.

## Features
- Your favorite Flash Games running on the Ruffle Flash emulator (and AwayFL for AS3 later on)

- HTML5 Games, that you may see on other more popular websites.

- FNAF Demo Games. These do not include the full versions, only 2 nights for FNAF 1 and 2, and 3 for FNAF 4. Pizzeria Simulator and UCN will be fully accessable as they are already free.

## Planned Features
- Youtube Unblocking program to remove the Restricted Mode feature (will not remove 18+ restrictions)

- Hidden Tab Details for easier security

- Lack of History Logging

- DOS Games like the shareware version of DOOM 1993, running through JS-DOS

- Mirrors if the only current one gets blocked
